## Problem Statement

Performed end-to-end sales data analysis using Power BI to identify trends, patterns, and business insights. Collected and cleaned raw sales data from multiple sources, transformed it using Power Query, and built data models to enable accurate reporting. Created interactive dashboards and visualizations to track sales performance, revenue, profit, regional sales, and product-wise analysis. Used DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as total sales, growth rate, monthly trends, and customer contribution. The analysis helped stakeholders make data-driven decisions, improve sales strategies, and monitor overall business performance effectively.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : There were a lot of null values ​​present in one of the fact tables, so I replaced the null values ​​using the left join function.
- step 4 : Built relationships between tables (fact table, Dim Product,Dim Promotion, Dim Customer, Date Table 1, Date Table 2) to enable accurate analysis.
 

- Step 5 :Stack holder wants to show top/bottom 5 products based on sales/profit/quantity sold, so I created stacked bar chart in Power BI and showed top/bottom 5 products based on sales, profit and quantity.
- Step 6 : Stackholder wants to Show relationship between sales & profit, than i created Scatter Chart in power Bi and show the relationship between sales and profit.
- Step 7 : Stackholder wants to Compare sales/profit/quantity sold between any two periods selected by the user so I created a two time period column using DAX expression was written.
  
          Date Table 1 = CALENDARAUTO(). 
          Date Table 2 = CALENDARAUTO().
  Snap of new Date column ,

   
  
- Step 8 : The stakeholder wants to show sales by different cities, I have shown all the different cities using a map.

      
       


           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.
- Step 10 : A bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the number of satisfied & neutral/unsatisfied customers. While creating this visual, field named "Gender" was also added to the Legends bucket, thus number of customers are also seggregated according the gender. 
- Step 11 : Ratings Visual was used to represent different ratings mentioned below,

  (a) Baggage Handling

  (b) Check-in Services
  
  (c) Cleanliness
  
  (d) Ease of online booking
  
  (e) Food & Drink
  
  (f) In-flight Entertainment

  (g) In-flight Service
  
  (h) In-flight wifi service
  
  (i) Leg Room service
  
  (j) On-board service
  
  (k) Online boarding
  
  (l) Seat comfort
  
  (m) Departure & arrival time convenience
  
In our dataset, Some parameters were assigned value 0, representing those parameters are not applicable for some customers.

All these values have been ignored while calculating average rating for each of the parameters mentioned above.

- Step 12 : In the report view, under the insert tab, two text boxes were added to the canvas, in one of them name of the airlines was mentioned & in the other one company's tagline was written.
- Step 13 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using shapes option from elements group a rectangle was inserted & similarly using image option company's logo was added to the report design area. 
- Step 14 : Calculated column was created in which, customers were grouped into various age groups.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
        Age Group = 
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=25, "0-25 (25 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=50, "25-50 (50 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=75, "50-75 (75 included)",
        
        "75-100 (100 included)")))
        
Snap of new calculated column ,

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total count of customers.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

 - Step 18 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
